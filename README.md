# CatDogClassifier
Playground project to predict whether the given image has a cat or dog.Used different CNN architectures with varying accuracy.

The code has been scripted in Python 2.7 ( Hence there would be some package and library discrepencies when you try to use Python 3)

The training and test data is greater than 25MB.Will share link for it pretty soon(it should be publicly available)
